Though it may seem long, it ensures that no details are missed, which is essential, when developing a plan to address your tax needs.zzzzzzzz",
	"003": "Next, I will create a shared folder that allows us to securely transmit documents. We will determine which platform e.g. Dropbox, Google Docs, Box, Citrix, Tresorit, best suits your needs..zzzzzzz",
	"004": "After the questionnaire is completed and you have uploaded your source documents, I can evaluate your position and we can discuss a plan and fees. I would then prepare a draft return which would be submitted to you for review and we can discuss any concerns.zzzzzzz",
	"005": "For your convenience, I accept multiple payment methods including Venmo, PayPal, Apple Pay, QuickPay with Zelle, bank check, credit cards via Square and Bitcoin (Coinbase).zzzzzzzzzzzz",
